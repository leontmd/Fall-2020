and also made it easy to contact the professor and view the courses page. put a total percentage of the learning outcome completion and
the evalutaion metric completion at top of page. simple and intuitve design.

course page: split each learning outcome into a container with simple and intuitive view of assignments, 
exams and student samples in each learning outcome. there is a form for a professor to upload more evalutaion metrics (dummy form).
put a learning outcome status if the learning outcome has all 3 evalutaion metrics complete/uploaded
