# Team Triangle EduApp

To build:

```
$ cd path/to/project
$ sudo ./build
```

The build script should download the necessary libraries / tools and build each. If it does not seem to work run it again, then submit an issue. 

The project requires Python 3.7, which will install in the build script. Ensure ample space is available.
