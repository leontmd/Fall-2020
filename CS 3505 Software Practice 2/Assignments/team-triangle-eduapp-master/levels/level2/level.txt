For Loops

Loops help accomplish work that needs
to be repeated, like covering the same
large distance with the tank.

Here's some syntax for Python:
for r in range(10):
    forward()
    backward()

The indentation (tab or four spaces) after
the `for` line creates a code block which
continues to the next code line without
indentation. Any code in this block is
executed as part of the loop 10 times -
once for each number 0, 1, ..., 9
