Welcome to Snake Tanks!!!

Here, you will learn basic coding
concepts by using Python to manuever
your tank across the map.

In this first level, you will learn 
about sequential statements.

Sequential statements, are bits of code
that are interpreted one after another,
in the order in which they are written
Use the following sequential statements 
(function calls) to move the tank and
complete level 1.

forward()    // Moves the tank forward
turn_left()  // Turns the tank left
turn_right() // Turns the tank right
shoot()      // Shoots the tank turret
backward()   // Moves the tank backward

The first 3 commands are done for you

Other controls:
Ctrl+c       // Copy selected text
Ctrl+v       // Paste copied text
Ctrl+s       // Save progress - dialog
Ctrl+o       // Open previous save
