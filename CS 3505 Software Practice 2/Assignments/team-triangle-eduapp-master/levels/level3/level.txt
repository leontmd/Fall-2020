Conditionals

Loops can help with simple levels,
but sometimes there are obstacles in 
the way! Using conditions, loops can
still be used to solve the level.

Using object_ahead(), which returns true if
there is an object in the way, write a
solution that uses loops and conditions.

Here is an example:

for r in range(5):
    if object_ahead():
        shoot()
    forward()

Here, the if statement will only execute its
block if its the condition (object_ahead()) is
True. Otherwise, the block will be skipped.

Another thing to note is that this code
block is nested. Code blocks can be put
inside other code blocks just by increasing
the indentation of its parent by four spaces.
