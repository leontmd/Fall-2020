Theorem 4.6.1 : Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages.
• IF L is regular, then that IMPLIES
• There is a natural number N such that
• for any string w ∈ L where w is at least of length N,
• we must be able to read out w as xyz
• where y is non-empty (x and z could be empty)
• and xy is confined to the first N steps of w
• and furthermore, for all i≥0, xyiz ∈ L must be true.
