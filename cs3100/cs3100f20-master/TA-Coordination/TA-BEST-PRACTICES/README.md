* This course has material that will trip up even the most
  confident of people. Be sure to recognize when you

  - don't understand a student question

  - a concept taught in class

  If you are unsure, please do not make up an approximate answer.
  **Please** contact me for clarifications before you answer a
  student.

* On the other hand, I am also still learning this topic and how
  best to teach it; and TAs often come up with better answers/solutions.
  
* Also I AM KNOWN TO SAY THE WRONG THING (by accident, mostly). If
  something does not sound right, kindly speak up! We need to tell the
  students factually correct things.

* To tell you where you stand as TAs, I'll be issuing a list of
  questions within Some-Tricky-Questions.tex now! If you can't answer these
  questions, don't feel bad, but kindly

  - work with me 1-1 (initially you may prefer this)

  - discuss with everyone openly (no harm admitting ignorance; we are
    all here to learn!)

* Please debug all assignment, quiz, and exam questions. Bugs
  or ambiguities in questions can spoil the fun for everyone.

* For those assignment problems you are grading, I require you
  to construct a solution as soon as the assignment is issued.
  If you have trouble, I'd be very happy to help!

* Prompt grading is crucial! If the workload is high, I can reduce
  the amount of material. More important is TIMELY feedback.

* Please explore the best Piazza practices to give back comments
  to students.

* If they are thinking right, please don't cut too many points. They
  have every chance to be earning points in the exam + quizzes (they will
  be "gimme" points if they studied).

* The most misunderstood of concepts are these:

  - Many will struggle with the Pumping Lemma (regular and CFL)

  - Many will struggle with mapping reductions

  - They will struggle with proofs of the kind S* = S**

  - They'll struggle with nondeterminism and PDAs

  In these cases, they need to be given the right feedback

* Because of the tight scheduling of the class and the Fall 2020
  stress, etc., I won't give extensions or make-up questions. (These
  make timely grading + the preparation of grade Excel) tricky.

* Be aware of the Speedgrader bug that if you concurrently grade,
  and/or enter/change entries fast, you will see corrupted data.
  Often you SEE more corrupted things than the corruption actually
  occurring. But sometimes it is very wierd -- gives NaN (not a
  number) IEEE error. Watch out!

* Assignments are there to give feedback. Since I'm dropping 2 asgs (and
  I might drop more), it is OK to cut points if they are going in a
  flawed direction. (Then only can they present the correct solution
  in an exam -- which is where they can earn back those points.)

* Invariably people turn in things late. I'll silently allow another
  30 mins wrt the published submission cut-off.

* We have no late policies because we won't accept anything late,
  barring the unforeseen issues (then we need documentation)
