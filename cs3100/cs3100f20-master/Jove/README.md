* Jove helps you learn about various Models of Computation as well as what is usually called ``Automata Theory''

* There are two directories here:

  - For_CS3100_Fall2020 is tailor-made for the Fall 2020 offering of the CS 3100 class. That directory will have self-contained instructions
    and this is where my current class students must be working initially.

  - For_The_Public is for the general public or CS 3100 students who want more examples to look at

* There is no secret in any of these directories! So, For_The_Public folks are welcome to use the
  contents of For_CS3100_Fall2020 (and vice-versa).

* Under For_The_Public, there are two directories:

  - Classic has Jove as described in the book Automata and Computability.
    Its documentation of files and directories matches the book more closely.
    It is a bit too complex in layout, but since many of the files are referred to in the book,
    I'm not deleting anything.

  - Recommended has a more modern presentation of the content.

* Jove can be run on your own laptop if you have Anaconda and Jupyter on your laptop.
  Or it can run via Colab **without needing any installations.**

* For the Colab path,

  - Visit https://github.com/ganeshutah/Jove.git on a web browser
    that has a Colab Chrome extension.

  - Then visit an ipynb and hit the Chrome Extension to run the code

  -  Here is a video that tells you how exactly how:

     --> YOUTUBE VIDEO: https://youtu.be/vhZGUFhm9fY <--

     (The paths mentioned in this video are subject to change;
      basically navigate up-to an ipynb and then click on the Chrome
      Colab extension icon.)

* If you are running it on your laptop (**highly recommended for speed, etc**),

  - Follow the instructions in For_The_Public/Classic/README.md
    or README_Short.md or read Jupyter_Notebook_Installation.pdf

  - Once installed, type "jupyter notebook" in this directory
