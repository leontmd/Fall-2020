These are the notebooks to run for Week-5.

* We need to practice a lot to internalize the details of REs
  (regular expressions) as they arise in practice quite frequently.
  I provide the following notebook RE_Exercises_For_Quiz4.ipynb
  that ties in nicely with Quiz-4.

* We also have exercises on DFA minimization; I provide two notebooks:
  - Min_DFA_Examples.ipynb
    - Has a collection of examples one can run
    
  - Min_DFA_Code_and_Example.ipynb
    - Has the above examples but also has the minimization code
      that one can study
